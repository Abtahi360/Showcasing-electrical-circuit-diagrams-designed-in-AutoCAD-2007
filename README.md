# Electrical Circuit Diagrams Designed in AutoCAD 2007

This repository contains a single AutoCAD 2007 `.dwg` file with four electrical circuit diagrams (1A, 1B, 1C, 1D) created as part of a CAD midterm assignment. Each circuit is meticulously drawn to demonstrate proficiency in AutoCAD for electrical design, adhering to the assignment's requirement to use only AutoCAD 2007. The designs are ideal for students, educators, or hobbyists interested in learning or teaching CAD-based circuit design.
