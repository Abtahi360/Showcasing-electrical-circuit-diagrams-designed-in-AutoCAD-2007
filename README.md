# Electrical Circuit Diagrams Designed in AutoCAD 2007

This repository contains a single AutoCAD 2007 `.dwg` file with four electrical circuit diagrams (1A, 1B, 1C, 1D) created as part of a CAD midterm assignment. Each circuit is meticulously drawn to demonstrate proficiency in AutoCAD for electrical design, adhering to the assignment's requirement to use only AutoCAD 2007. The designs are ideal for students, educators, or hobbyists interested in learning or teaching CAD-based circuit design.

## What’s Used

- **Software**: AutoCAD 2007
- **File Format**: `.dwg` (AutoCAD Drawing)
- **Design Elements**: Standard electrical symbols (resistors, capacitors, transistors, etc.) as depicted in the provided circuit images
- **No External Libraries or Scripts**: Pure AutoCAD drafting with manual drawing tools

---

## Functions and Features
- **Multiple Circuits in One File**: Four unique circuits (1A–1D) organized in a single `.dwg` file for easy access and review.
- **Accurate Electrical Schematics**: Each circuit is drawn with precision, following the provided diagrams, ensuring clarity and functionality.
- **AutoCAD 2007 Compatibility**: Designed specifically for AutoCAD 2007, making it accessible for users with older software versions.
- **Layered Design**: Circuits are organized using AutoCAD layers for easy editing and visibility control.
- **Scalable and Editable**: The `.dwg` file allows users to zoom, modify, or annotate the circuits for learning or customization.

---

## Attractive Options for Common Users
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Perfect for CAD students or beginners learning to draw electrical schematics in AutoCAD.
- **Educational Resource**: Useful for instructors or students studying electrical engineering or CAD design.
- **Portfolio Piece**: Showcase your AutoCAD skills in a professional or academic portfolio.
- **Reusable Templates**: Circuits can be reused or modified for other projects or assignments.
- **Cross-Version Compatibility**: The `.dwg` file can be opened in newer AutoCAD versions for further enhancements.
- **Visual Learning**: Clear, well-drawn circuits help non-experts understand electrical schematics.
